# California Housing Price Prediciton

Data analysis and modeling on California housing prices. 

Extracted features, removed outliers and trained a Random Forest Regressor on the dataset.
Current accuracy is **81.5%**.

Plan to develop full stack web application that allows users to get price estimates on California houses.

Created a way for users to access this model on a website. Used Flask as the backend to load the model. Currently in the process of hosting the website. The link will be available here soon.
